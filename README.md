# Dropbox-for-Salesforce

In Dropbox_Service class there are number of methods that allow to interact with Dropbox api, such as upload file to Dropbox from Salesforce and directly from Javascript. Creating folder in dropbox, getting folder / file info, getting content of a folder info, searching within Dropbox account.

Later planning to add method which will allow to download files from Dropbox to local machine.
